# üöÄ Deployment Checklist - Production Database Fix

## ‚úÖ Changes Applied

### 1. **Prisma Client Configuration** (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Changed from custom output path to standard `@prisma/client`
- ‚úÖ Updated all imports to use `@prisma/client`
- ‚úÖ Removed custom path from `.gitignore`

### 2. **Build Scripts** (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Added `prisma generate` to build script
- ‚úÖ Added `postinstall` script for automatic generation
- ‚úÖ Ensures Prisma client is generated on every deployment

### 3. **Environment Variables** (Action Required)
- ‚úÖ Created `.env.example` with all required variables

## üîß Required Actions Before Deployment

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Production

Go to your hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify/etc.) and add these environment variables:

#### **Required:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?pgbouncer=true"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db"
```

#### **Optional (if using Supabase client features):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
```

### Step 2: Test Locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (will auto-run prisma generate)
npm install

# 2. Run development server
npm run dev

# 3. Verify recipes load at http://localhost:3000/reseptler
```

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Switch to standard Prisma client for production compatibility"

# 2. Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## üîç What Was Wrong?

### **Problem:**
- Custom Prisma output path (`src/generated/prisma`) was gitignored
- Generated files weren't included in production builds
- Production had no Prisma client ‚Üí all database queries failed

### **Solution:**
- Use standard Prisma location (`node_modules/@prisma/client`)
- Auto-generate on install/build via scripts
- Standard location is never gitignored

---

## ‚ú® Expected Results After Deployment

### **Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Recipes page empty in production
- ‚ùå Database queries fail silently
- ‚úÖ Works fine locally (had generated client)

### **After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Recipes load in production
- ‚úÖ Database queries work everywhere
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior local/production

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If recipes still don't load after deployment:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Verify `prisma generate` runs during build
   - Look for "‚úî Generated Prisma Client" message

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Confirm `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
   - Ensure it includes proper credentials and host

3. **Check Database Connection**
   - Verify database is accessible from production
   - Check firewall/security rules allow connections

4. **Check Application Logs**
   - Look for Prisma connection errors
   - Check for authentication failures

### Common Errors:

**"Cannot find module '@prisma/client'"**
- Solution: Ensure `postinstall` script runs or manually run `npm run db:generate`

**"Can't reach database server"**
- Solution: Check `DATABASE_URL` and database firewall rules

**"Authentication failed"**
- Solution: Verify database credentials in environment variables

## üìö Additional Notes

### Database Connection Pooling

Your schema uses two connection strings:
- `DATABASE_URL`: With pgbouncer pooling (for app queries)
- `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`: Direct connection (for migrations)

This is optimal for serverless deployments (Vercel/Netlify).

### Caching Strategy

Your app includes built-in caching:
- Recipes: 5 minutes
- Featured recipes: 10 minutes  
- Categories/Regions: 20 minutes

This reduces database load and improves performance.
